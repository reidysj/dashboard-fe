This project is based on the tutorial written here:
https://medium.com/stackanatomy/creating-a-responsive-admin-dashboard-with-react-f4a0193782e5

There are several goals involved in the larger picture of this project:

1. Hand type all of the given features.
   - Why? Copying and pasting is boring. Plus, I will be noting areas that could use improvement.
2. Translate the given features to be used for a different purpose (tbd).
   - Why? -> I am not a product designer or project manager. I needed a springboard for a new project idea and features to include in it.
3. Remove static data and create a custom backend for the new purpose.
   - Why? -> I am a full stack developer who loves working on backend features. Plus, I'd like this to be a fully functional application.
4. Implement any features that appear to simply be placeholders.
   - Why? -> Some features may lead to furthering my skills.
5. Add additional features, both on the front- and back-end.
   - Why? -> This will help me become more well rounded as a software engineer; I'll be able to better to contribute to teams I am on in the future if I have skills in this area.

## TODOS

- If pages has its own style folder, so should components
- Route naming conventions
